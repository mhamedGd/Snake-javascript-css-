<h1>To start the game you need to create a local server</h1><br>
<h2>If you have python you can easily do that by:</h2><br>
<ul>
  <li>Navigating to the folder containing your "index.html" in the CommandPrompt</li>
  <li>Then typing "py -3 -m http.server" if your python version is above 3</li>
  <p>     Or "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" if  your python version is above 2</p>
  <li>Go to your browser and type "localhost:8000" or whatever port the server would provide you.</li>
</ul>
