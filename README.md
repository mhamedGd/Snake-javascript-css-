To start the game you need to create a local server.
If you have python you can easily do that by:
  -Navigating to the folder containing your "index.html" in the CommandPrompt
  -Then typing "py -3 -m http.server" if your python version is above 3
    -Or "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" if  your python version is above 2
  -Go to your browser and type "localhost:8000" or whatever port the server would provide you.
